# Background information
"Sustainability issues affect all of humanity, though the exact nature of the issues differs due to the context of each place. An example is climate change; a small tropical island state like Singapore is affected directly and indirectly by climate-related risks. Warming global temperatures see Singapore experiencing changes in weather patterns with more intense rainfall. Rising sea levels due to melting ice caps and the thermal expansion of seawater mean potential loss of low-lying land as well as floods. Events that occur in one part of the world have a ripple effect felt and seen by other parts of the world too, including Singapore. Singapore’s reliance on food imports, for instance, means that the resilience of farming in places like the Mekong Delta is of importance. Threats to agricultural areas such as droughts and saltwater incursion caused by climate change and changes to river systems due to dams and riverbed mining impact farmers who might decide to stop farming and move to cities in search of alternative livelihoods, an act that affects global and regional food supplies. There is an urgency to understand what is happening to other people in countries across the globe, as well as the need to search for solutions to the problems they face. These solutions may mean the need to help others mitigate and adapt to climate change even though they are not in Singapore, as all live in a hyper-connected world.

Concern for preserving the physical environment (e.g., protecting forests and nature spaces, as well as preventing pollution of the natural environment) begins as early as the late 1800s. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, environmental education gains traction, with the Belgrade Charter (UNESCO, 1975) recognizing that to conserve the physical environment, the social, cultural, and political dimensions must be addressed as well. Over time, “environmental education” changes to “sustainability education” as there is more recognition of the importance of integrating the complex inter-relationships among the physical environment and social, cultural, and political aspects of societies into environmental education. An international resolution adopted by the United Nations (UN), the “Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014),” emphasizes the need to integrate sustainable development issues like climate change, biodiversity, and disaster risk reduction into all aspects of education and learning (UNESCO, 2005). In 2015, the UN adopts the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which not only broaden the scope of sustainable development issues but also continue the emphasis on sustainable development through education (UN, 2015).

Schools play an important role in developing the knowledge and skills that young people need to participate in sustainability issues and work towards those UN sustainable development goals. Geography is a natural fit during UNESCO’s Decade of Education for Sustainable Development as it is a discipline that addresses issues like climate change, biodiversity, and disaster risk reduction. However, with the breadth of sustainable development goals today, all subjects have the capacity to tackle and engage students on sustainability issues. Science subjects engage students around the science of climate change, impacts of development, and climate change on ecologies. Social Studies is a key subject that educates students about governance. Sustainable development and climate issues involve governance and how individuals can engage with the state on these matters. Languages and Art subjects focus on how to communicate about sustainability issues too. A holistic and interdisciplinary approach to sustainability education is important, and the Ministry of Education’s Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP) serves as one of the important building blocks in this endeavour. The implementation of ESP in local educational institutes sees schools and institutes of higher learning integrating sustainable development into their curriculum, campus infrastructure, institutional culture and practices, as well as partnerships with the community.

Reflecting further on the future direction of sustainability education, the good work done in schools in this area is acknowledged. However, it is also important for school leaders and teachers to think ahead and develop more innovative pedagogies in their approach to sustainability education. If these issues are taught in a factual way, then students will treat them just like any other topic they are required to learn for assessment. Students should be encouraged to understand how people in other parts of the world are already impacted by issues like climate change. For example, how do people without air-conditioning or stable water supplies cope with heatwaves and droughts, and who are the people who are losing their homes to rising sea levels? It is also important that students are provided with positive examples of what people are doing to overcome these problems. These could be in the form of innovations, community initiatives, and partnerships among individuals, businesses, and governments. Students should realize that the problems the world faces are not necessarily insurmountable, and that they have the power to make informed decisions and take individual and collective action. It would be best if students are empowered to apply these insights to issues they themselves have witnessed and want to address."
# Test information
The test will have less than 10 MCQ questions. The topics tested include:
- Impacts of climate change
- Effects of the impacts of climate change, e.g. supply chain disruptions
- How to achieve sustainability
- Details about specific initiatives mentioned (UN Initiatives, MOE Initiatives)"""}
